### What's this?
Firefox Nightly is the latest preview version of Firefox, updated twice a day. It's so fresh, so good for developers and hardcore users.  
But unfortunately, it's MSIX package release does not provide automatic updates, nor manual update via the about page.

This tool was designed for users who use MSIX package version of Firefox Nightly occasionally and feel tired of manually downloading and installing the package.
